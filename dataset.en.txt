This recipe book is written in both English and Bisakol to promote the Bisakol language, spoken in Southern Sorsogon.
In this book, you will find the recipes in an easy side-by-side English and Bisakol layout. 
It is aimed both at people who are interested in the language, and also at people who want to taste some favorite dishes from the Philippines. 
Tamarind pork soup
Boil the water. Boil the tamarind for thirty minutes until soft.
Take the tamarind out of the water, dry it and peel it. 
Crush until the juice is extracted.
While boiling the water, saute the garlic and onion.
Add the pork and cook until slightly browned.
Add one liter of water, let it boil in the pot for forty-five minutes.
Put the tamarind juice in the boiling pork. 
Add the vegetables, starting with the taro first. Boil for ten to fifteen minutes.
Put in the chili, tomatoes, snake beans, okra and eggplant.
Put in salt, fish sauce and pepper.
Lastly, add the water spinach.
Remove from the fire as the vegetables will be cooked by the residual heat.
Whenever I come to Sydney, I bring two dozen packets of sinigang mix from the Philippines.
There are two flavors of sinigang mix - one just with tamarind, and one with tamarind and taro. I like the one with taro because it makes the soup stickier.
How to cook
Stingray with coconut milk
Boil the stingray until it is cooked.
Drain the stingray.
Strip the leaves of the moringa and chili from the stems.
Slice the onion, garlic, chili and ginger up finely.
Flake the flesh of the drained and dried stingray flesh. If desired, remove the skin.
Saute the ginger, then the onion and garlic.
Next, add the flaked stingray.
Add ground pepper, salt and one-fourth cup of vinegar.
Saute the mixture until it becomes dry.
Then, add 2 cups of coconut milk.
Stir until the mixture boils.
When the coconut milk boils, add the chili.
Add the moringa.
After it boils, add the chili leaves.
Top with chili.
Whenever I come home, there is always kinunot na pagi on the table because Mom knows that this is my favorite.
Beef and peanut stew
Heat the oil in a pan then sauté the garlic and onion.
Add pepper and mix.
Add the beef chunks until slightly browned.
Add the ground peanuts. (You can ground peanuts with a food processor until fine or use peanut butter).
Add beef broth and let boil. Add water if needed until the beef is soft. This takes around an hour.
When the broth begins to boil, cover the pot until the beef is soft.
While the beef is boiling, blanch the vegetables individually.
As soon as the vegetables are blanched, submerge them in ice and cold water then dry them.
Add fish sauce to the broth.
Mix the rice flour and annatto in half a cup of water. Add to the beef stew. (The more annatto you add the more vibrant the color will be).
Keep on heat until the stew thickens.
Plate the dish. Either mix the vegetables with the stew or have them separate.
Add prawn paste separately.
I did not eat Kare-kare before. My housemate taught me how to make it when I came to Australia.
"Alright, I’ll take the top end of the tree, cause that’s where the bananas grow", said the Tortoise.
"Oh! You can’t do that. I saw it first, the top end is mine’, said the Monkey.
They cut the banana tree.
The Monkey got the end part.
The Tortoise got his share too.
They went home and planted their parts in their backyards.
After a few days, what the Monkey planted had died.
But the Tortoise’s plant grew and bore fruit.
The Monkey came and cried.
"My tree died", said the Monkey.
The Tortoise was sad as well.
It doesn’t know how to climb the tree.
"Don’t be sad", said the monkey.
"I’ll climb the tree and when I reach the top, I'll throw you some ripe bananas."
The Monkey climbed the tree.
But when it reached the top, it ate all the bananas, and didn’t give any to the Tortoise.
The Tortoise got mad.
So the Tortoise put thorns all around the tree.
When the Monkey climbed down, it felt the pain.
"Ouch!", shouted the monkey.

My name is Sophie De La Rosa. I live in Barangay Bonifacio in Bulan.
I will tell you what I do everyday.
Maybe we both do the same thing. Come! We will learn about my life and our place.
I wake up at four am in the morning. When I wake up I feed the chickens, pigs and goats.
Mum cooks breakfast while I feed the animals. The usual food we eat in the mornings is fried rice and dried fish.
When I walk to school, I have to walk through the rice fields to get to the road. I don’t wear my shoes until I reach the road so they don’t wear out.
It takes about an hour to walk to school. My other classmates ride the tricycle because it’s faster.
Maam taught us about Philippine history using Bisakol.
My teacher said the Spaniards came to the Philippines in 1521.
They were initially looking for spices. And they eventually liked the country, so they conquered us. They stayed in the Philippines for 333 years.
So Filipinos learned Spanish. Even here in Bulan, we have a lot of words adopted from Spanish.
Our break is from twelve to one. I don’t go home during lunch because our house is too far. My classmates ride the tricycle home.
My usual packed lunch is rice and sardines.
After lunch, I have class until four in the afternoon.
After class, I walk home to help mum and dad pack the rice which they dried for the whole day.
At 7pm, my family comes together to eat dinner at the dinner table.
Rice and vegetable or fish is our usual dinner.
After dinner, I do my assignments and watch TV with my family.
At 9pm, I brush my teeth and go to sleep.
Thanks for sharing my day with me. Bye!
My father ran for municipal councilor.
It is expensive to study in Manila.
I will give my mother some money.
Just give her the allowance.

“Grrrah,” The crocodile groaned.
“Hush now, the food will come by soon, then we will both have something to eat.” The aswang said lovingly to her pet.
Prey was hard to come by these days, the humans knew that this place in the swamp was the hunting ground for the aswang and her pet, but that wasn’t about to stop her from finding a meal.
“We just have to go closer to the village, and then everything will be better,” The crocodile grunted again and the aswang reassured him. “I know, we’ll find some children, I know how much you like the taste of those.”
The crocodile wagged its tail with joy; it had not had that treat in many months.
“Yes, let’s go nearer to the village and set a trap. We can catch the ones swimming by the river!”, the aswang walked alongside her pet to the riverbank.
She was hungry, and so was her pet. Due to the human’s caution, food was hard to find. The last meal they both had was a fisherman that strayed too far into the swamp. He was stringy and tough, not a dinner that either of them savored.
The aswang was all smiles though. She knew that prey would be plentiful. She had always relied on the strength of her pet to catch their meals, she was not like the other aswang who would fly around the village terrorizing the humans.
She was an agalon hayopan, a kind of aswang that would raise crocodiles to hunt their prey for them. The other aswang would often jeer and call their kind lazy, but they would never know the hardship one would take just to raise a single crocodile from an egg.
The crocodile grumbled again and she laughed. They spent years together and she had raised this one ever since he was a hatchling. She knew his quirks and quips just as well as he knew hers.They were inseparable. She knew that once he had something to eat, he would change back to his lazy self.
“We’re here,” The aswang and her pet stood by the river.
“Time to get some food.”
“Grrrah,” replied her pet.
